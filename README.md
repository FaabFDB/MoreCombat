# MoreCombat
 
This plugin uses PaperMC v1.16.5, it doesn't have anything special and is a rough idea of where i want to go with it.

You can also add potion effect(s) to the sword if you want to do that with a certain timit limit.

Usages:

/morecombat addbowability <Ability>

/morecombat addswordability <Ability>

/addpotioneffect <Potion Effect> <Amplify> <Duration eg: M:S, MM:SS>
